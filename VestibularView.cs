// Works like the vestibulo-ocular reflex: the camera stays where the head puts it, and only turns so it keeps
// looking at one point on the line the player means to look along (the mouse look plus free look), the set
// distance ahead of a steady eye. The head's bob and its turn from each step are turned out of view. Yaw and
// pitch are balanced fully; the turn about the view axis (roll) only by the torsion share, as real eyes counter-roll
// only a small part of a head tilt.
// Aiming, mounting, scene guns, vaulting, climbing and the BTR are left as they are.
// With the dynamic distance on, the point is whatever that line hits, found the way a bullet finds its target.
