// The hideout's player model dressed from the gear worn, as in a raid. The game dresses it from the shooting range's
// copy of the gear (HideoutPlayer's range inventory), filled with copies on entering the range and emptied on leaving,
// not from the gear the inventory screen shows and saves (OriginalInventory): outside the range it shows the player in
// the first person, no body seen. In this mod's third person the body is seen, so the model's slots watch the worn gear
// itself, as a raid's do the player's own, in the range and out of it: put on, taken off or changed in part (goggles on
// a helmet), the model follows at once; entering or leaving the range changes nothing on it; and its devices, and the
// settings kept for them, are the worn items' own. In the range the player holds a copy of a weapon worn: the weapon in
// its slot is then not shown on the body, as the game does with the one held. With this mod off, the game's copy again.
// Per frame only two references are compared.
