// The eyepieces' light on the wearer's face: each lens throws the picture it shows back toward the eye, and seen from
// outside it lights the eye sockets, the bridge of the nose and the cheeks. Every point of the lens sends its light
// over the eyepiece's field of view, so at the face, an eye relief out, the light is the lens's disc spread by that
// field: full where every part of the field comes from the lens, fading out over a rim as wide as the field is there
// (the share of each point's cone that the lens fills). A spot light on each lens's axis, behind it, throws that
// profile from its cookie, sized to the face's distance; the GPNVG-18's two lenses of an eyecup throw the "8" between
// them. In the colour of the tube's phosphor as the picture is drawn (BRNVG's, else the game's filter's) and as bright
// as the tube is lit (warming up, dying away); none for thermal goggles, their display kept dim at night. For the main
// camera and the eyes, which see it on the eyecups' rims and the housing by the lenses; not for the thermal, IR or
// optic cameras.
