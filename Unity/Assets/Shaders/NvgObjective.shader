// wide, seen from the lens, as the aperture over its distance from it; here the blur's radius is a limit's share,
// half of it at a set distance from the lens, more the nearer and less the further, so that it grows along the gun.
// Made of smooth Gaussian blurs at a few sizes, at a quarter of the frame's size and smaller (nothing is gathered pixel
// by pixel, so nothing shows as noise or blocks), in two layers: what is near (blurred by more than a quarter-size
// pixel and a half) is cut out with how much of each pixel it covers and blurred as wide as it is spread, and laid
// over the rest, which is blurred by its own small amount: a near thing's blur covers what lies behind it softly, and
// leaves it sharp.
// Pass 0: the frame at a quarter of its size, its blur radius in alpha (in quarter-size pixels).
// Pass 1: a Gaussian across (_Step: one texel across), its spread a texel and a half. Pass 2: the same, up.
// Pass 3: the frame, with what is near laid over it.
// Pass 4: what is near, at a quarter of the size, premultiplied by how much of each of the sixteen pixels under it it
//         covers. Pass 5: its blur radius the same way (red: radius times cover, green: cover).
// Pass 6: how blurred each part of the frame is (0 to 1), at a quarter of the size.
// Pass 8: tritium vials' occlusion over their discs, an atlas tile each. Pass 9: their discs, added
//         (NightVisionTritium.cs, NightVisionTrace.cs).
// Pass 10: a magnified sight's lens into a mask. Pass 11: the light through it, on the sight camera's picture
//         (NightVisionScope.cs).
// Pass 7: the lenses' picture once the game's or BRNVG's filter has made it, its grain eased where the frame was
//         blurred (_Mask): the filter's noise, one pixel fine, made a blurred thing look textured and its edge hard.
