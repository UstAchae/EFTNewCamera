// The eyepieces put together, right where BRNVG would draw its picture over the main camera's frame. _MainTex is
// the frame as BRNVG got it (the naked eye's scene) and _NightVision what BRNVG made of it (open lens, no mask):
// the tubes are 1x, so each line of sight through a lens shows the night-vision picture in its own direction.
// On the left half of the screen the left eye's view, on the right half the right eye's (with one camera both are
// where it is). Each eye drew its own half of the main view from its own place: the device alone (premultiplied,
// its coverage in alpha) and its lens map; the scene is the main camera's wherever the device does not cover it.
// A tube shows only its own field: a line of sight further off its axis than that finds no picture, so from the
// side a lens is dark glass.
// The eyepieces are lamps in the dark: their light, spread wide and soft (NvgGlow.shader), is laid back over
// everything, a glow on the glass and the eyecups around the lenses. It all follows the tubes' power: rising over a
// moment when switched on, mottled while the gain settles, and fading like phosphor when switched off.
// One pass only: the game's SSAA stage blits with every pass of a material.
// While the device flips with the filter off the eyes are put in at the SSAA stage instead, _NightVision black.
