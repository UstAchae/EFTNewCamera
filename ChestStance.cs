// tap from a hold: the aim key's press is held back until it is known which it is. Let go within a moment, it was a
// click, and the aim is taken then as the game takes it (its own toggle: a click again ends it); still down after the
// moment, it is a hold, and the aim is taken straight into this stance, which lasts while the key is held and ends the
// aim when it is let go. The game's aim stays on throughout, so the sway, breath and recoil are the aimed ones
// (AimArms places the gun); only its slowdown is lifted, and the mouse turns as when walking.
