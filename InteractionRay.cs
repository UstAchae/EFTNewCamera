// What the player looks at to interact with (loot, doors, switches, tripwires): the game casts it from a point on the
// first-person rig (PlayerBones.LootRaycastOrigin) along its forward, where the game's own camera is. This mod puts the
// camera elsewhere (at the eyes of the third-person skeleton, at the aiming eye), and the screen's centre dot no longer
// marked what was picked. While this mod places the camera, the ray is the camera's: from it, through the centre of
// the screen, started as far behind as the game starts it (EFTHardSettings.BEHIND_CAST).
