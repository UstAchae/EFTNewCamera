// The FPS camera placed before its post-processing makes its frame's commands. PostProcessing builds them in its own
// OnPreCull, with the camera's view as it stands then (the screen-space reflections' view matrix among them), and
// that came before the cameras' pre-cull callback in which this mod places the camera: the reflections were worked out
// from the game's own camera place and turn while the frame was drawn from this mod's, and laid a dark band over the
// ground that followed the view (the more, the more the head was turned by the middle button). This mod's placing
// is done first, from the post-processing's OnPreCull, once a frame (NewCameraSwitch.OnCameraPreCull).
