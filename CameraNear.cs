// The FPS camera's near clip plane brought closer while this mod places the camera. The camera sits close under the
// helmet's brim: in a raid the game's plane is 3 cm (the hideout's 1 cm), and what is nearer is cut away; through the
// cut (a shell drawn from the outside only) the scene behind shows. The plane is set once and kept, not changed and
// handed back every frame: the frame's motion vectors and the upscaler's history then see the one plane the frame is
// drawn with. Never farther than the game's own; the game's put back when this mod lets go.
