// The helmet mount the device hangs from, set as a wearer sets it. A Norotos TATM (vanilla) has a base on the helmet:
// a plate, a vertical track with a knob on top, and a carriage riding the track; turning the knob runs the carriage up
// or down. The arm hangs from the carriage on a link (the hinge the device flips up on at its top, a pair of pins at
// its bottom the arm tilts on), and has a toothed slot along it that the shoe's slide rides in, fore and aft. The
// model has the base and the arm each as one mesh (of separate pieces), so each is read back once through the GPU
// (they are not readable on the CPU) and split into what moves. The player sets the three: the carriage's height
// (the knob turns with it), the arm's tilt and the slide's place on the slot, by hotkeys held while the eyepieces
// show and the weapon is not aimed. Each mount (the item, not its kind) keeps its own, in a file of the plugin's
// beside its config. Applied only for the main camera's rendering and put back
// after it: the game's own pose is never touched.
// A Wilcox L4 G24 (the GPNVG-18's own mount) is set the same three ways: its carriage, with the hinge and the shoe,
// rides up or down a plate on the helmet once its lock lever is swung open (it swings back when let go); a screw on
// the hinge sets the tilt; and fore and aft, with the release button pressed, the goggle moves from slot to slot of
// the ten along the shoe's rack (the button's pawl drops into the one it is let go at). There the base mesh holds
// plate, carriage, lever and screw, and the goggle's own mesh holds the shoe and the button. The rack's slots are
// only painted (the normal map), read off it.
// Wilcox's own L4 G24 (WTT's, black or coyote), with a goggle's adapter in its shoe, is set the same three ways too:
// everything but the plate on the helmet rides up or down once the lock lever on the carriage's face is swung over to
// its other side (it swings back when let go); the tilt, on the hinge, turns the knob at its end once the lock knob on
// the carriage's other side is turned a couple of turns loose (tightened again when let go); and fore and aft, with
// the buttons on the shoe's sides pressed in, the shoe slides along the arm. The base mesh holds the plate, the
// carriage with its lever, and the two knobs; the arm mesh, under the hinge, the arm, the shoe and its buttons.
