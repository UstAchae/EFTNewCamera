// The picture of the player's own head-mounted night vision, shown inside the device's eyepieces instead of over
// the whole screen. The picture is BRNVG's own, made where it always makes it, over the main camera's frame: this
// mod only places it. Just before BRNVG draws, its renderer is set to an open lens with no mask, no tube layout,
// vignette or edge distortion (the eyepieces here are the aperture); what it makes goes into the lenses and the
// frame it was given stays as the naked eye's scene around them. The tubes are 1x and afocal, so every line of
// sight through a lens shows the picture in that same direction. Which lens each pixel looks through comes from a
// lens map: the device's own meshes drawn from the eye, with the round lenses its texture paints on the eyepieces'
// floors (the GPNVG-18's two to an eyecup, making its "8"). While it shows, the game's own filter adds nothing.
// Needs BRNVG; the devices whose eyepieces have been measured are listed in Devices.
//
// The eyepieces light up when the device is switched on, the moment the game lights its green glow, and go dark
// when it is switched off, as the device flips; BRNVG's renderer is woken for that while the game's filter still
// waits for the flip to end. The glow itself stays off. Like real tubes they strike rather than fade in: switched
// on, a tube's output jumps at once to about half, flickering and mottled, and reaches full within a moment;
// switched off, it goes out with only a brief phosphor afterglow. The four do not quite keep step: each switch
// gives each tube its own small delay.
//
// The device itself is drawn by the eyes (see NightVisionEyes), not the main camera: what BRNVG works on must be
// the scene beyond the device, which the lenses look out at. With one camera both eyes stay where it is.
// Binocular view: one camera cannot sit behind both eyecups, so while the eyepieces show the camera splits in two
// where it is, like two eyes, each drawing the device from its own place over its half of the main camera's view.
