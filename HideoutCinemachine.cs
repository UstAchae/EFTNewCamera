// The hideout's camera as a raid's. In the hideout a Cinemachine brain on the FPS camera drives it from the hideout's
// virtual cameras: the overview's rails, and while the player walks about a fixed one of its own (VCamera_player, set
// by HideoutCameraController), whose lens (its field, near and far planes) the brain pushes onto the camera every
// frame after this mod has placed it. While this mod has the camera (walking about, not the overview, whose free
// camera is the brain's), the brain is off, as in a raid there is none; given back as this mod lets go, before the
// overview's blend from the player's place starts.
